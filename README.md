## About

This project provides an introduction to assembly language and computer architecture, aimed at developers wishing to gain an in-depth understanding of how computers work internally. It is structured into several sections covering basic concepts of the Von Neumann architecture and the difference between CPU architectures, to a detailed explanation of the syntax and instructions of x86 assembly language.

In addition to explaining theoretical concepts, the text includes practical examples of assembly language programs, such as the classic "Hello world," accompanied by step-by-step explanations of their functioning. It also provides information on how to install and run programs written in assembly language using the NASM assembler on Ubuntu-based systems.

In general terms, the text aims to demystify assembly language and demonstrate its importance and relevance in understanding the inner workings of computers, as well as in optimizing and developing low-level software. Additionally, it highlights the philosophy of sharing knowledge by offering the book and its content under the public domain, thus promoting an open and collaborative learning environment.
